Neurons in primate prefrontal cortex signal valuable social information during natural viewing,s3.3:social,"**1) Key Findings:**
- Neurons in the primate orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) are involved in processing valuable social information during natural viewing.
- Monkeys showed a preference for viewing videos of conspecifics over blank screens and preferred less predictable videos.
- Gaze behavior varied significantly with video content, indicating that certain social and biological elements strongly attract attention.
- Both OFC and LPFC neurons encoded information about video content and choice targets, with OFC showing a richer representation of social categories.

**2) Core Argument/Thesis:**
The study argues that the OFC and LPFC are integral to processing social information and guiding decision-making in dynamic, naturalistic environments. This supports the idea that these brain regions integrate information about relevant objects and events to form a representation suitable for learning the environment's structure and guiding decisions.

**3) Technical Advances:**
- Development of a 'channel surfing' task to study naturalistic decision-making in monkeys.
- Use of an ethogram to annotate video content frame-by-frame, allowing detailed analysis of social behaviors.
- Application of elastic net regularization in GLMs to handle large numbers of correlated regressors in neural data analysis.

**4) Cognitive Implications:**
The findings suggest that primate decision-making involves complex neural processes that integrate social information, indicating that the OFC and LPFC play crucial roles in evaluating and responding to social stimuli. This has implications for understanding the neural basis of social cognition and decision-making in both humans and non-human primates.

**5) How it Provides Evidence for the Subsection:**
The study contributes to the theme issue on economic behaviors among non-human primates by demonstrating that social information carries economic value, influencing decision-making processes in the brain. It provides empirical evidence of how primates prioritize social information, which is crucial for understanding the evolution of economic behaviors.

- The lack of preference for specific behaviors in presentation decisions could be due to the cognitive load of decision-making or the novelty of the videos, suggesting alternative interpretations of the data.
- The study's reliance on naturalistic stimuli may limit the control over experimental variables, potentially affecting the interpretation of neural responses.

**7) Connection to Previous & Next Sections:**
The study builds on previous research on the neural basis of decision-making and social cognition, extending it to more naturalistic settings. It sets the stage for future research exploring the neural mechanisms underlying complex social behaviors and decision-making in dynamic environments, potentially linking to studies on the evolution of social cognition and economic behaviors in primates."
Neuronal Population Encoding of Identity in Primate Prefrontal Cortex,s3.3:social,"### 1) Key Findings
- The ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) in macaques primarily encodes the identity of conspecifics during the perception of naturalistic audiovisual expressions.
- Single neurons in the VLPFC exhibit complex and nonselective responses to stimuli, but population-level activity allows for accurate decoding of both identity and expression.
- Population responses to the same identity follow similar trajectories in the response space, facilitating segregation from other identities.

### 2) Core Argument/Thesis
The study argues that while single neurons in the VLPFC show low selectivity for specific social stimuli, the population-level activity is organized primarily around the identity of conspecifics. This organization allows for the accurate decoding of identity and expression, suggesting that identity is a critical feature of social stimuli that dictates the structure of population activity in the VLPFC.

### 3) Technical Advances
- Utilization of naturalistic audiovisual stimuli to better approximate real-world conditions.
- Application of pseudo-population decoding and principal component analysis to assess the encoding capabilities of the VLPFC at the population level.
- Development of a sliding bin analysis to identify responsive units based on Poisson probability.

### 4) Cognitive Implications
The findings suggest that the VLPFC plays a crucial role in social communication by encoding the identity of conspecifics. This encoding is achieved through population-level activity, which allows for the integration of complex, multisensory social information.

### 5) How it Provides Evidence for the Subsection
The study provides evidence for the subsection on neuronal population encoding by demonstrating that the VLPFC encodes identity and expression through population-level activity. This supports the idea that the VLPFC is involved in processing complex social stimuli, contributing to our understanding of its role in social behavior.

### 6) Potential Controversies & Alternative Views
- The use of pseudo-populations assumes independence among neurons, which may neglect noise correlations that could affect the population response space.
- The study's reliance on naturalistic stimuli limits control over specific features, such as gaze direction or mouth movement amplitude, which could influence neuronal responses.
- Alternative views may argue for a more significant role of individual neurons or other brain regions in encoding social stimuli.

### 7) Connection to Previous & Next Sections
- **Previous Sections**: The study builds on previous research that identified face-selective neurons and multisensory integration in the VLPFC, expanding the understanding of how this region processes social stimuli.
- **Next Sections**: The findings may lead to further exploration of the VLPFC's role in social communication networks and its interactions with other brain regions involved in processing social information. Future research could investigate the specific features of social stimuli that are encoded in the VLPFC and how these features contribute to social behavior."
Social Context-Dependent Activity in Marmoset Frontal Cortex Populations during Natural Conversations,s3.3:social,"**1) Key Findings:**
The study investigates the neural activity in the frontal cortex of marmosets during natural vocal conversations. It finds that small but widespread changes in firing rates across frontal cortex neurons occur in response to social contexts of vocalizations. These changes are evident even before the vocalization is heard and are correlated with the likelihood of the marmoset producing a vocal reply. The magnitude of these changes scales with the length of the conversation, suggesting a role in facilitating social monitoring and conversational exchanges.

**2) Core Argument/Thesis:**
The research posits that the frontal cortex activity in marmosets is closely linked to social context-dependent changes that facilitate natural vocal communication. This neural activity is not driven by the acoustic properties of vocalizations but rather by the social context, indicating a shift in brain state that supports social monitoring and coordination during conversations.

**3) Technical Advances:**
The study employs recordings from freely moving marmosets interacting with a virtual conspecific, allowing for the observation of naturalistic social communication. The use of microelectrode arrays in multiple frontal cortex areas provides detailed insights into the neural mechanisms underlying social communication in primates.

**4) Cognitive Implications:**
The findings suggest that the frontal cortex plays a critical role in social monitoring and decision-making processes during vocal exchanges. The neural activity observed may reflect mechanisms of social arousal and attention, which are crucial for the coordination and timing of conversational turn-taking.

**5) How it Provides Evidence for the Subsection:**
The study provides empirical evidence linking frontal cortex activity to social communication, supporting the hypothesis that primate social cognition involves complex neural processes beyond simple sensory and motor responses. This aligns with the broader understanding of the primate brain's evolution to support intricate social behaviors.

**6) Potential Controversies & Alternative Views:**
One potential controversy is the interpretation of the observed neural activity as related to social arousal and attention. Alternative views might argue for different underlying mechanisms, such as sensory gating or decision-making processes. Additionally, the study's reliance on a virtual conspecific might limit the generalizability of the findings to natural interactions with live conspecifics.

**7) Connection to Previous & Next Sections:**
The study builds on previous research highlighting the complexity of primate social communication and the neural circuits involved. It sets the stage for future investigations into the specific neural mechanisms that facilitate social interactions and how these processes might differ between natural and artificial communicative contexts. The findings also suggest avenues for exploring how similar neural mechanisms might operate in human social communication."
Representation of distinct reward variables for self and other in primate lateral hypothalamus,s3.3:social,"### 1) Key Findings
- The lateral hypothalamus (LH) in primates encodes distinct reward variables for self and others, influencing socially motivated behavior.
- LH cells represent the subjective value of self-rewards and the likelihood of rewards for both self and others.
- Coherent activity and top-down information flow from the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) contribute to signal encoding in the LH.
- Deactivation of LH cells eliminates the motivational impact of other-rewards, indicating its role in social brain networks.

### 2) Core Argument/Thesis

- It sets the stage for future research to explore the specific types of social information conveyed between these areas and their role in social cognition disorders."
Agent-based representations of objects and actions in the monkey pre-supplementary motor area,s3.3:social,"**1) Key findings:**
The study identified distinct types of neurons in the monkey pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) that encode actions and objects based on the agent involved. These neurons include self-type (ST) neurons, which respond to the monkey's own actions, other-type (OT) neurons, which respond to another agent's actions, and self- and other-type (SOT) neurons, which respond to both. Notably, object-related neurons exhibited agent selectivity before action onset, suggesting an ""object-mirroring"" mechanism that allows prediction of others' actions by using the same motor representation as if the observer were acting.

**2) Core argument/thesis:**
The study argues that the pre-SMA in monkeys hosts an ""object-mirroring"" mechanism that enables the prediction of others' actions by recruiting the same motor representations used for planning one's own actions. This mechanism is distinct from classical action-mirroring and is crucial for understanding and predicting social interactions.

**3) Technical advances:**
The research utilized single-neuron recordings from area F6 of monkeys during a visuomotor task, both when the monkeys performed actions and when they observed an experimenter performing the same actions. The study employed cross-modal population decoding to reveal how neurons integrate object and context information to generate agent-shared signals.

**4) Cognitive implications:**
The findings suggest that the pre-SMA's object-mirroring mechanism plays a significant role in social cognition by enabling observers to predict others' actions based on shared motor representations. This mechanism may be foundational for understanding social interactions and could inform models of social cognition in primates.

**5) How it provides evidence for the subsection:**
The study provides evidence for the subsection on mirror neurons and social cognition by demonstrating that the pre-SMA contains neurons that encode both self and others' actions and objects. This supports the idea that mirror neuron systems are involved in understanding and predicting social interactions.

**6) Potential controversies & alternative views:**
One potential controversy is the interpretation of the object-mirroring mechanism as distinct from classical action-mirroring. Alternative views might argue that these findings could be explained by existing models of mirror neuron function without positing a separate mechanism. Additionally, the space-constrained nature of object-related neuron activity might be debated, as it suggests limitations in the generalizability of the findings.

**7) Connection to previous & next sections:**
The study builds on previous research on mirror neurons by extending the understanding of their role in the pre-SMA, particularly in relation to object processing and action prediction. It sets the stage for future research on the neural basis of social cognition and the integration of object and action representations in other brain areas. The next sections could explore the implications of these findings for understanding human social cognition and potential applications in artificial intelligence and robotics."
Flexible gaze-following in rhesus monkeys,s3.3:social,"### 1) Key Findings
- Rhesus monkeys demonstrated the ability to follow gaze flexibly, using cognitive processes to infer what others see, rather than merely reflexively matching gaze direction.
- In Study 1, monkeys were more likely to look up when they could see the target of the demonstrator’s gaze, but did not frequently reorient their bodies to view out-of-sight locations.
- In Study 2, monkeys were more likely to approach and look behind a barrier when they could not initially see the target of the demonstrator’s gaze, indicating an understanding of line-of-sight.

### 2) Core Argument/Thesis
The study argues that rhesus monkeys possess cognitive gaze-following abilities that allow them to infer what others see, even in non-competitive contexts. However, their motivation to engage in such behaviors is limited compared to humans and other primates like great apes.

### 3) Technical Advances
- The study utilized a novel experimental setup involving barriers to test cognitive versus reflexive gaze-following in rhesus monkeys.
- The design allowed for the separation of simple gaze matching from more complex cognitive processes involving reorientation to view hidden targets.

### 4) Cognitive Implications
- The findings suggest that rhesus monkeys can understand and use information about others' visual perspectives, a foundational aspect of theory of mind.
- However, their low motivation to engage in gaze-following in non-competitive contexts may indicate differences in social cognitive development compared to humans.

### 5) How It Provides Evidence for the Subsection
The study provides evidence that rhesus monkeys can engage in cognitive gaze-following outside of competitive contexts, challenging the notion that their social cognitive abilities are limited to competitive scenarios.

### 6) Potential Controversies & Alternative Views
- Some may argue that the low motivation observed in rhesus monkeys could be due to the use of human demonstrators rather than conspecifics, though the study argues against this interpretation.
- Alternative views might suggest that the monkeys' behavior is still primarily driven by competitive instincts, even in seemingly neutral contexts.

### 7) Connection to Previous & Next Sections
- The study builds on previous research that has shown basic gaze-following abilities in rhesus monkeys and other primates, expanding the understanding of their cognitive capabilities.
- It sets the stage for future research to explore how social tolerance and different social contexts influence gaze-following and other social cognitive processes across primate species."
A Naturalistic Dynamic Monkey Head Avatar Elicits Species-Typical Reactions and Overcomes the Uncanny Valley,s3.3:social,"### 1) Key Findings
- The study developed a naturalistic rhesus monkey face avatar that successfully elicited species-typical reactions from rhesus macaques, overcoming the ""uncanny valley"" effect observed with less naturalistic avatars.
- Monkeys avoided looking at less naturalistic avatars, but not at the most naturalistic or most unrealistic avatars, indicating an uncanny valley effect for intermediate realism.
- The naturalistic avatar evoked facial expressions in monkeys comparable to those seen in response to real monkey videos.

### 2) Core Argument/Thesis

- The study highlights the importance of naturalistic motion and appearance in avatars to elicit appropriate social and cognitive responses in primates.

### 5) How it Provides Evidence for the Subsection
The study provides evidence that the uncanny valley effect is not solely a human phenomenon and can be observed in non-human primates. It demonstrates that the effect can be overcome with sufficiently realistic avatars, supporting the idea of an evolutionary basis for this reaction.

### 6) Potential Controversies & Alternative Views
- Some may argue that the uncanny valley effect is not purely evolutionary but influenced by learned experiences or cultural factors.
- Alternative views might suggest that the uncanny valley is more related to specific abnormal features rather than realism per se, as the study found avoidance of intermediate realism rather than the most realistic avatars.

### 7) Connection to Previous & Next Sections
- The study builds on previous research that identified the uncanny valley effect in monkeys, extending it by demonstrating how it can be overcome with naturalistic avatars.
- It sets the stage for future research on the use of avatars in social cognition studies, emphasizing the need for validation of synthetic stimuli in behavioral experiments with primates."
Decoding of the other’s focus of attention by a temporal cortex module,s3.3:social,"### 1) Key Findings

- GFP neurons are capable of integrating contextual information, allowing for flexible control of gaze-following behavior.
- The study demonstrates that monkeys, like humans, can follow gaze to establish joint attention, although they rely more on head gaze cues than eye gaze cues.

### 2) Core Argument/Thesis
The research posits that the GFP in the temporal cortex is a specialized neural module that plays a pivotal role in social interactions by decoding and responding to gaze cues, thereby facilitating joint attention. This module is adaptable, integrating contextual information to modulate gaze-following behavior.

### 3) Technical Advances
- The study employs electrophysiological recordings from single neurons in the GFP and adjacent STS regions to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying gaze-following behavior.
- The use of tasks that require monkeys to follow gaze or suppress it based on contextual cues provides insights into the cognitive processes involved in gaze following.

### 4) Cognitive Implications
- The findings suggest that the GFP is integral to the cognitive control of social attention, enabling the observer to shift attention based on another's gaze direction.
- The study supports the idea that gaze following is a domain-specific cognitive faculty, potentially shared across primate species, that contributes to the development of a theory of mind.

### 5) How it Provides Evidence for the Subsection
The study provides empirical evidence for the existence of a neural substrate dedicated to gaze following, supporting the notion of a homologous system for joint attention in primates. This is demonstrated through the identification of GFP neurons that selectively respond to gaze cues and modulate their activity based on social context.

### 6) Potential Controversies & Alternative Views
- There may be debate over whether the GFP is a domain-specific module or part of a broader attention network. The study argues against the latter by showing that GFP neurons are specifically tuned to social cues rather than abstract symbols.
- The reliance on head gaze cues in monkeys versus eye gaze cues in humans could be seen as a limitation in generalizing findings across species.

### 7) Connection to Previous & Next Sections
- The study builds on previous research that identified cortical patches involved in face processing and gaze direction extraction, extending this work by pinpointing the GFP as a key player in gaze following.
- Future sections could explore the connectivity between the GFP and other brain regions, such as the lateral intraparietal cortex, to further elucidate the neural circuitry underlying social attention and joint attention mechanisms."

Socially meaningful visual context either enhances or inhibits vocalisation processing in the macaque brain,s3.3:social,"**1) Key Findings:**
The study demonstrates that rhesus monkeys systematically associate the meaning of vocalizations with the meaning of visual scenes. Neural responses in the lateral and superior temporal sulcus are enhanced when vocalizations are congruent with visual context and inhibited when incongruent. This indicates a neural network representing social meaning irrespective of sensory modality.

**2) Core Argument/Thesis:**
The research argues that macaques possess an amodal representation of social meaning, allowing them to integrate auditory and visual information based on semantic congruence. This ability to associate vocalizations with visual contexts suggests a precursor to human linguistic capabilities.

One potential controversy is the interpretation of the findings in the context of predictive coding theory, which would predict higher activations for incongruent stimuli due to prediction errors. The study's findings of enhanced responses to congruent stimuli challenge this theory, suggesting an alternative mechanism of match enhancement.

**7) Connection to Previous & Next Sections:**
The study builds on previous research exploring face, voice, and social scene processing in monkeys, extending it to the integration of audio-visual stimuli based on social meaning. It sets the stage for future research on the development of internal models and the neural basis of social cognition in primates, potentially linking to studies on human social and linguistic evolution."

Neural activity tracking identity and confidence in social information,s3.3:social,"### 1) Key Findings
- The study found that humans exhibit more accurate and stable confidence judgments when learning from social sources compared to non-social sources, despite identical statistical information.
- Neural activity in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and posterior temporoparietal junction (pTPJ) was more closely associated with confidence in social information.
- Multivariate patterns in these brain areas encoded the identities of social information sources more strongly than non-social ones.

### 2) Core Argument/Thesis
The research argues that social learning involves specialized neural mechanisms that differ from those used in non-social learning. This specialization is evident in both behavioral confidence judgments and neural activity patterns, suggesting that humans process social information differently and more reliably than non-social information.

### 3) Technical Advances
- The study employed a tightly controlled within-subject experimental design, ensuring that differences in behavior and neural activity could be attributed solely to the social versus non-social nature of the information source.
- A Bayesian model was used to derive trial-wise belief distributions, allowing for a detailed analysis of confidence and uncertainty in participants' judgments.

### 4) Cognitive Implications
The findings suggest that humans may have an inherent bias towards forming more stable and confident judgments about social information. This could be due to an expectation of consistent behavior from social agents, which influences how new evidence is integrated into existing beliefs.

### 5) How it Provides Evidence for the Subsection
The study provides empirical evidence for the subsection on the specialization of neural processes in social cognition. By demonstrating distinct neural activation patterns and behavioral responses to social versus non-social information, the research supports the idea that social learning relies on specialized cognitive and neural mechanisms.

### 6) Potential Controversies & Alternative Views
- One potential controversy is the assumption that differences in neural activity are solely due to the social nature of the information, rather than other confounding factors.
- Alternative views might argue that the observed differences could be due to the framing of the task or the inherent complexity of social interactions, rather than specialized neural mechanisms.

- **Next Sections:** The findings pave the way for future research to explore the causal mechanisms underlying the observed neural specializations and to investigate how these processes might be leveraged in practical applications, such as designing interactive tools for decision-making."
Viewing Ambiguous Social Interactions Increases Functional Connectivity between Frontal and Temporal Nodes of the Social Brain,s3.3:social,"### 1) Key Findings
- The study found that viewing ambiguous social interactions in monkeys increases functional connectivity between frontal and temporal nodes of the social brain.
- Activation was observed in the superior temporal sulcus, parietal cortex, medial and lateral frontal cortex, and the caudate nucleus during social interactions.
- Ambiguous interactions led to a pronounced increase in temporo-temporal and cingulate-temporal functional connectivity, suggesting enhanced coordination in these areas when making difficult social inferences.

### 2) Core Argument/Thesis
The research argues that the social brain network, particularly the connectivity between frontal and temporal regions, is dynamically modulated by the social context of interactions. Ambiguous social interactions require more complex neural processing, reflected in increased network synchronization.

### 3) Technical Advances
- The study utilized fMRI to measure brain activity in awake, behaving monkeys, allowing for the observation of dynamic changes in functional connectivity in response to social stimuli.
- A novel approach was used to assess dynamic functional connectivity through phase synchrony, providing insights into the temporal dynamics of brain networks.

Selective Prefrontal–Amygdala Circuit Interactions Underlie Social and Nonsocial Valuation in Rhesus Macaques,s3.3:social,"### 1) Key Findings
- The study demonstrates that the medial frontal cortex (MFC) and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in rhesus macaques have distinct roles in social and nonsocial valuation, respectively, and these roles depend on their interactions with the amygdala.
- Monkeys with MFC-amygdala disconnections showed reduced social valuation, while those with OFC-amygdala disconnections exhibited deficits in goal-directed decision-making based on food value.

### 2) Core Argument/Thesis
The research argues that distinct prefrontal-amygdala circuits are responsible for different types of valuation in rhesus macaques: the MFC-amygdala circuit is crucial for social valuation, whereas the OFC-amygdala circuit is essential for nonsocial, goal-directed decision-making.

### 3) Technical Advances
- The study employed crossed surgical disconnections to isolate the functional interactions between the amygdala and specific prefrontal regions (MFC and OFC).
- Utilized selective excitotoxic lesions to ensure precise targeting of brain regions, avoiding damage to fibers of passage.
